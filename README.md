# About Me

My name is Chan Nyein Wai but other people know me as bytehx on twitter.
I'm an infosec and programmer enthusiast, specially a 21 years old application security enginner from Myanmar(Burma). 
During the last 4 years, I've been participating in different cyber security events and competition. I've been doing recently Bug Bounty Hunting, Security Research and writing tools for contribution to community.
I work as application Security Engineer  in day and I hunt bugs mainly on synack at night.
